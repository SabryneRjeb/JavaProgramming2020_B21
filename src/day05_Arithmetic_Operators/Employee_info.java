Warmup tasks:
        1. create a class named EmployeeInfo
                declare the following variables:
                    firstName, lastName, gender, age, companyName, jobTitle, isFullTime, isMarried, salary
            write a program that can display the full info of the employee
                    ex:
                             firstName = John
                             lastName = Daniel
                             gender = M
                             age = 35
                             companyName = CapitalOne
                             jobTitle = SDET

                             isMarried = false
                             salary = 120000.50

             output:
